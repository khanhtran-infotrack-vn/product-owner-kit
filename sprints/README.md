# Sprints

Sprint plans, boards, and standup templates organized by sprint number.

## No sprints yet

To plan your first sprint:
- Use the `sprint-planner` skill: "plan next sprint with [X] story points capacity"
- Stories must be in `backlog/` and marked `Ready for Sprint` first

## Conventions

- Sprint folders: `sprint-N/` (sequential)
- Capacity is in story points
- Recommended commitment: 80-90% of capacity to allow for unknowns
