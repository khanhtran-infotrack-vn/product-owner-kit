# Product Vision: Electronic Signature Platform

## Overview
Our electronic signature platform enables businesses to digitally sign, send, and manage documents securely and efficiently. We serve SMBs and enterprises across legal, real estate, HR, and financial services sectors.

## Target Users
1. **Business Users**: Document senders, contract managers, HR administrators
2. **Signers**: Recipients who need to sign documents (both internal and external)
3. **Administrators**: IT staff managing organizational settings and compliance
4. **Developers**: Teams integrating eSignature capabilities via API

## Current Platform Capabilities
- Document upload and preparation (PDF, DOCX, XLSX)
- Signature field placement (signature, initial, date, text, checkbox)
- Multi-party signing workflows (sequential, parallel, custom routing)
- Email notifications and reminders
- Audit trail and compliance tracking
- Mobile signing (iOS and Android apps)
- REST API for integrations
- Template management
- Bulk send capabilities

## Current Pain Points (Based on User Research)
1. **Mobile experience is clunky**: 35% of signatures happen on mobile, but users report frustration
2. **Template creation is complex**: Power users create templates, but find the process time-consuming
3. **Limited automation**: Users want to trigger workflows based on business events (CRM deals, HR onboarding)
4. **No AI assistance**: Users manually prepare documents, place fields, and route to signers
5. **Integration gaps**: Popular apps (Slack, Teams, Salesforce) lack deep integrations
6. **Analytics are basic**: Users want predictive insights (completion rates, bottlenecks)

## Strategic Goals for 2025
1. **AI-First Experience**: Intelligent document preparation, field detection, routing suggestions
2. **Mobile Excellence**: Best-in-class mobile signing experience
3. **Deep Integrations**: Native experiences in tools users already use
4. **Automation Platform**: No-code workflow builder for business users
5. **Predictive Analytics**: Help users optimize their signing processes

## Competitive Landscape
- **DocuSign**: Market leader, comprehensive features, expensive
- **Adobe Sign**: Strong brand, integrated with Adobe ecosystem
- **PandaDoc**: Document creation + eSignature, focus on sales
- **HelloSign (Dropbox)**: Simple UX, affordable, limited enterprise features

## Our Differentiators
1. Transparent pricing (no per-envelope charges)
2. Unlimited templates and users
3. Superior customer support (live chat, onboarding)
4. Fast implementation (< 1 week average)
5. Modern, intuitive UI

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption**: Monthly active senders, documents sent per user
- **Efficiency**: Time to send document, signature completion rate
- **Retention**: Logo retention rate, net revenue retention
- **Satisfaction**: NPS score, customer effort score (CES)
