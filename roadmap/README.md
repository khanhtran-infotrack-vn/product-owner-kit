# Roadmap

Product roadmap plans organized by quarter or release.

## Structure

## No roadmap yet

To create your roadmap:
- Use the `prioritization-engine` skill: "prioritize these features: [list features]"
- Use the `sprint-planner` skill to align sprint commitments to roadmap milestones
- Reference backlog stories by ID in roadmap documents

## Conventions

- Roadmap horizon: rolling 4 quarters
- Each quarter lists: committed features (must ship), target features (aim to ship), stretch goals
- Link to backlog stories for detail
